# Catch the Rabbit

Your task is to catch the rabbit! The rules are simple:
* there are 100 boxes
* the rabbit spawns randomly in one of them
* the rabbit will go left or right before you can look into one box
* you can look 1 time at a turn
* if you look at the box the rabbit is in, you have won 

###Can you find the algorithm that always catches the rabbit?

To solve the small logic task simply edit the file `src/look.js`. The code will run in a loop and if you catch the rabbit you will get a hint.
